# Data
This project uses a variety of spatial and tabular datasets from public sources, including the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), and Oregon’s GEOHub. Our analysis focuses on intersection-level crash patterns from 2007 to 2022 and incorporates information on infrastructure, lighting, traffic volumes, and population.

We created a fully normalized PostgreSQL database structured around a master `intersections` table. All other datasets were cleaned, filtered, and joined to this central reference using either shared intersection identifiers or approximate spatial joins based on latitude and longitude. This structure enabled consistent and flexible querying by location and allowed us to integrate diverse datasets into a unified schema.

### Crash Data  
The core of our analysis is built on over 350,000 crash records from ODOT. We filtered this dataset to include only bicycle- and pedestrian-involved crashes and dropped entries with missing or invalid coordinates. We standardized street names and assigned each crash to an `intersection_id` based on a match between reported street names and our intersections table. The resulting `crashes` table contains fields such as date, severity, crash type, and intersection assignment.

### Bicycle Infrastructure  
We used PBOT’s bicycle network dataset to represent infrastructure for cyclists in Portland. This data includes named facilities such as bike lanes, greenways, and paths, along with the year each segment was built. Many fields were incomplete or inconsistently formatted, so we standardized facility types and installation dates. Segments were then linked to nearby intersections based on proximity and street name references. The cleaned output populates the `bicycle_network` table.

### Lighting  
The `street_lights` dataset includes point-level records with clean coordinates and attributes such as ownership and power type. We validated and transformed coordinates to WGS 84, then performed a spatial join to assign each light to its nearest intersection. We calculated the number of lights and total wattage per intersection as proxy indicators of lighting coverage.

### Traffic Calming Features  
This dataset included point features such as speed humps, curb extensions, and raised crosswalks. Records had valid coordinates but inconsistent identifiers, which we cleaned and filtered to remove unknown or unplaced entries. We then joined features to intersections using spatial proximity. The resulting `traffic_calming_features` table allows us to flag the presence and type of calming measures at each location.

### Traffic Volume  
The `traffic_volume_counts` dataset includes detailed counts by direction, time of day, and date. We aggregated volume data at the intersection level and joined records using spatial coordinates. This variable helps us control for exposure in later modeling by approximating how many vehicles pass through each location.

### Intersections  
We generated the intersections table using the `osmnx` Python package and OpenStreetMap street data. The table includes a deduplicated list of intersections across Portland, with each entry containing a unique `intersection_id`, latitude, longitude, and the names of the intersecting streets. The table serves as the central node for all joins and normalization steps in the database.

### Excluded Data  
While initially considered, removed the recommended bicycle routes dataset after determining that it duplicated information available in the bicycle network layer and lacked the detail needed for meaningful comparison. 
&&&&&While initially considered, we excluded the speed limit dataset due to the lack of reliable coordinates and inconsistent street naming. 
&&&&&&In both cases, the data could not be confidently joined or was unlikely to add new explanatory power to our analysis. Proxies for risk, such as crash severity, lighting, and calming infrastructure, were already present in our model.

### Final Schema  
All datasets were aligned to WGS 84 and cleaned to support accurate joining. Each resulting table contains only the fields necessary for analysis and follows consistent naming conventions. Each record—whether a crash, street light, or calming feature—can now be attributed to a specific intersection. This enables comparison of safety outcomes based on local infrastructure conditions and supports analysis at the intersection level.
