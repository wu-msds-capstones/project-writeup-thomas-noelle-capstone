## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Crash Trends and Severity

As shown in Figure 2a, annual crash counts were relatively stable with a moderate decline during 2019–2021 (COVID-19 pandemic), while bicycle- and pedestrian-involved crashes remained a small but persistent share of all crashes.

Similarly, Figure 2b illustrates the distribution of injury severity levels for all crashes compared to those involving bicycles or pedestrians.

### Infrastructure Coverage and Grouping

Neighborhood greenways are distributed across Portland, spanning both east and west sides of the city. While coverage is denser in areas with a connected street grid, they are not limited to any single quadrant. Traffic calming features were often co-located with greenways, reinforcing their intended function as low-stress cycling routes. Over 40 percent of intersections lacked both greenways and calming features, creating a natural baseline group.

### Crash Rates by Infrastructure and Traffic Volume  

To account for differences in traffic exposure, we calculated crash rates per intersection across combined infrastructure groupings (greenways and calming features) and stratified by traffic volume tertiles (low, medium, high). As shown in Figure 4, crash rates were highest in high-volume areas, regardless of infrastructure presence. However, intersections with calming features—particularly when paired with greenways—had lower crash rates than those lacking interventions or with greenways alone within this high-volume group.  

In medium- and low-volume areas, crash rates were substantially lower overall, with only minor differences between infrastructure types. This suggests that infrastructure interventions may have the greatest impact where traffic volumes, and therefore exposure risk, are highest.

### Speed Environment  

Analysis of posted speed limits revealed clear differences between street types. As shown in Figure 5, greenways consistently align with lower posted speed limits, while regular streets display a broader range of speed environments. Crashes resulting in severe outcomes were concentrated at higher speed limits, underscoring the relationship between speed and injury severity.

### Spatial Patterns  

Mapping bicycle- and pedestrian-involved crashes alongside Portland’s greenway network and traffic calming features provided a citywide view of crash concentrations and infrastructure coverage (Figure 6).

These exploratory findings informed our subsequent modeling strategy by highlighting key relationships between crash rates, infrastructure presence, traffic exposure, and speed environments at the intersection level. By integrating these variables into our schema and validating them through EDA, we established a foundation for statistical modeling aimed at quantifying their combined effects on bicycle- and pedestrian-involved crash risk.

## Feature Importance Analysis

To better understand the relationship between relevant features and bicycle or pedestrian safety, this study explores the use of classification models to categorize crash severity. The primary focus is not predictive performance but rather the interpretation of feature importance. Nevertheless, the predictive strength of a model can still provide some indication of the strength of the underlying relationships between variables.

### Data Subsets

To enhance the accuracy and interpretability of predictive models for crash severity, this study employs both aggregate and disaggregated datasets. Specifically, models are trained on all crash data, bicycle-involved crashes, and pedestrian-involved crashes as separate subsets. This approach is grounded in the recognition that different road user types are subject to distinct risk profiles, behavioral dynamics, and environmental interactions.

Modeling all crashes provides a comprehensive understanding of severity factors across the full spectrum of road users. However, disaggregating the data by crash type allows the models to capture subgroup-specific patterns that may be obscured in the aggregate analysis. For instance, factors influencing injury severity in pedestrian-involved crashes, such as lighting conditions or urban design features, may differ substantially from those relevant to motor vehicle collisions or bicycle-related incidents.

Disaggregating the data allows for the identification of road-user-specific risk factors that may be diluted or overlooked in models trained on the full dataset. By isolating the relationships between predictors and severity outcomes within bicycle- or pedestrian-involved crashes, the resulting feature importance measures can offer more targeted insights. This approach supports more nuanced interpretations of the data and facilitates the development of tailored safety interventions for each road user group.

### Target Variables

The target variable, crash severity, can be framed in a variety of different but related ways, each capturing a different aspect of the outcome. In this study, we examine three binary classification targets related to crash severity:

**Fatal Crash**: whether or not the crash resulted in a fatality.

**Injury Crash**: whether or not any injury was reported.

**Major Injury Crash**: whether the crash resulted in a severe injury, based on a consolidated classification.

For the third target, we group the injury types shown in Figure 2b into two broader categories: major injuries, comprising "Fatal Injury," "Suspected Serious Injury," and "Suspected Minor Injury"; and minor or no injuries, comprising "Possible Injury" and "No Apparent Injury." This aggregation reflects a simplified but policy-relevant distinction between more and less severe injury outcomes.

Although all three targets serve as proxies for crash severity, each provides a unique lens for analysis. For instance, fatal crashes are rare but socially critical, while the injury-based targets may capture broader systemic risk patterns across road users.

Because all three targets exhibit varying degrees of class imbalance, particularly fatal crashes, model interpretation must be situated within the context of imbalanced learning. Figure [X] presents the distribution of each crash severity target by road user type to illustrate the degree of imbalance and variation across populations.

```{r}
crashes_predictors %>% 
  select(fatal, injured, major, bike_flg, ped_flg) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(fatal, injured, major),
               names_to = "Target",
               values_to = "Target_Flag") %>%
  mutate(`Road User Type` = case_when(
    bike_flg == "Yes" ~ "Bike",
    ped_flg == "Yes" ~ "Pedestrian",
    TRUE ~ "Motorist"
  )) %>%
  group_by(Target, `Road User Type`, Target_Flag) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(Target, `Road User Type`) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Road User Type`, y = proportion, fill = Target_Flag)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  facet_wrap(~ Target) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Road User Crash Outcomes by Type",
       x = "Road User Type",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Flag (TRUE = Crash)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme_bw()

```

Of significant note is the class imbalance between fatal and non-fatal car crashes. Of the 94,841 crashes in our dataset, 373 (~0.4%) were fatal. Of those, 23 were bicycle crashes, and 148 were pedestrian crashes. The class imbalance persists for Bicycle, Pedestrian, and Motorists.

Unsurprisingly, most reported crashes that involve a bicycle or pedestrian also involve an injury. The remaining class imbalance for motorists is roughly divided in two, which justifies the class balance when training a model on all crashes rather than subsets of bicycles or pedestrians. 

On the other hand, by composing a feature of injury severity as explained above, the class balance between major and minor injuries for bikes and pedestrians are far more comparable.

### Predictor Subsets

Given the complexity and variation across road users and crash severity outcomes, it is equally important to consider the types of predictors used in modeling. To address this, we implement two modeling strategies: one utilizing all available predictors, and another constrained to infrastructure-specific features (e.g., road design, surface conditions, lighting, and traffic controls).

While models with all predictors allow for a more complete understanding of the multifaceted drivers of crash severity, they may also incorporate variables that are less actionable from a planning or policy standpoint. In contrast, infrastructure-only models are designed to isolate the influence of modifiable aspects of the built environment, which are most relevant to decision-makers in transportation planning and roadway design.

By comparing the feature importance outputs from these two model types, we can assess the extent to which crash severity can be explained by infrastructure alone, versus more complex contextual or behavioral variables. This dual approach supports both broad analytical insight and practical, intervention-oriented recommendations.

### Modeling

Given the central importance of feature importance in this study, we selected classification models that facilitate interpretable insights into the predictors of crash severity. Four modeling techniques were employed: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Logistic Regression with LASSO and Ridge regularization. These methods were chosen to provide complementary perspectives on variable importance, balancing interpretability and predictive robustness.

Models were trained for each combination of data subsets (all crashes, bicycle-involved crashes, pedestrian-involved crashes), target outcomes (injury vs. non-injury, fatal vs. non-fatal, degree of injury), predictor subsets (all features versus infrastructure-specific features), and model type. Each model was trained and evaluated using a five-fold cross-validation scheme on an 80/20 train-test split.

To account for class imbalances common in crash severity data, model performance was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa statistic rather than standard accuracy metrics. This choice enables a more reliable evaluation of predictive agreement beyond random chance.

To assess model stability and the consistency of feature importance, each model configuration was trained and evaluated across five iterations with different random seeds. For each configuration, the minimum and maximum Kappa values are reported, along with the three most influential features determined by a majority vote across iterations. This comprehensive framework yields a detailed comparison of model performance and key predictors across varying data partitions and model specifications.
