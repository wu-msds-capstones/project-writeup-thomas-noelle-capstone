# Background
Efforts to improve street safety for pedestrians and cyclists increasingly focus on the role of infrastructure design. While the addition of bicycle lanes, pedestrian crossings, and traffic calming features has become common practice in urban transportation planning, the effectiveness of such interventions depends on a range of contextual factors, including implementation quality, spatial placement, and surrounding traffic conditions.

In Portland, Oregon, neighborhood greenways are a key component of the cityâ€™s active transportation network. These low-traffic, residential streets are intended to reduce vehicle volumes and speeds, thereby creating a safer and more comfortable environment for non-motorized users. Typical design elements include speed bumps, traffic diverters, wayfinding signage, and enhanced crossings. More broadly, traffic calming measures (such as raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and median islands) aim to moderate driver behavior and improve visibility at critical points in the street network.

Since the early 2000s, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) has expanded its network of greenways to more than 100 miles throughout the city [@PBOTGreenways]. These efforts are integrated into broader policy initiatives, including the Vision Zero Action Plan and Safe Routes to School, which prioritize equity and the reduction of traffic-related fatalities and injuries. As part of this strategy, PBOT has also invested in targeted improvements at intersections identified as high-risk based on historical crash data [@PBOTCrashStats].

Intersections represent a particularly hazardous component of the transportation system. Unlike midblock segments, intersections concentrate multimodal activity and conflicting movements, increasing the likelihood of collisions. A disproportionate share of serious pedestrian- and cyclist-involved crashes in Portland occurs at intersections, reinforcing the importance of evaluating safety outcomes in these locations.

Existing research on the safety impacts of active transportation infrastructure has produced mixed findings. While several studies report that protected bike lanes, lighting, and calming features are associated with reduced crash frequency and severity [@Reynolds2009; @Lusk2011], others emphasize the role of broader contextual variables, such as traffic volume, land use, and roadway design [@ODOTInfrastructure]. Moreover, empirical analysis is often limited by inconsistent definitions of infrastructure types, limited geographic specificity, and challenges in isolating the effects of individual treatments.

This study contributes to the literature by leveraging a unified, intersection-level dataset that captures both crash outcomes and multiple categories of infrastructure features in Portland from 2007 to 2022. By focusing on neighborhood greenways, traffic calming treatments, and street lighting, we seek to evaluate whether these design interventions are associated with measurable improvements in safety for vulnerable road users.
