# Background
Creating safer streets for people who walk or bike requires more than simply adding infrastructure. The effectiveness of specific design strategies such as neighborhood greenways, traffic calming treatments, and lighting depends on how they are implemented, where they are placed, and how they interact with existing traffic conditions. In Portland, neighborhood greenways are designed to reduce motor vehicle volumes and speeds on residential streets. These routes are intended to create a low-stress environment for non-motorized users and often include traffic diverters, speed bumps, wayfinding signage, and improved crossings. Traffic calming features more broadly can include curb extensions, median islands, raised crosswalks, and other physical elements that encourage slower, more cautious driving behavior.

The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) began building its greenway network in the early 2000s and has since expanded it to over 100 miles throughout the city [@PBOTGreenways]. This work is part of broader initiatives aimed at improving transportation equity and safety, including Safe Routes to School and Portland’s Vision Zero Action Plan. PBOT has also made targeted investments in lighting and calming infrastructure at intersections identified as high-risk based on crash history [@PBOTCrashStats].

Intersections continue to be among the most dangerous places in the street network. Unlike midblock locations, intersections bring together users traveling in different directions and using different modes. A large share of serious pedestrian and bicycle crashes in Portland occurs at intersections, underscoring the need to evaluate how specific design elements influence crash risk and severity.

While many cities have expanded infrastructure to support walking and biking, past research on its effectiveness has produced mixed results. Some studies have shown that protected bike lanes and calming features are associated with fewer or less severe crashes [@Reynolds2009; @Lusk2011]. Others emphasize the importance of additional contextual factors such as lighting, traffic volume, and land use [@ODOTInfrastructure]. Researchers also face challenges related to inconsistent definitions of infrastructure types, limited data availability, and the difficulty of isolating the effects of individual features.

This project builds on that existing research by analyzing a unified dataset that captures a wide range of infrastructure features at the intersection level. By focusing on greenways, traffic calming, and lighting, we aim to better understand how Portland’s investments relate to the frequency and severity of pedestrian and cyclist crashes between 2007 and 2022.
